  # An algorithm that receives a group of Taxonomy IDs and the size m of the

  #
  # Args:
  #   taxon: (char/integer) Taxon from which to start sampling children taxa.
  #   m: (integer) size of the sample to generate.
  #   method: (char) whether the algorithm will choose IDs randomly or 
  #                  maintaining a balanced allocation (m_i differing by no
  #                  more than 1 if the maximum possible value wasn't reached).
  #   strict: (char) whether it favors balanced taxa representation 
  #                  (strict = "yes") or maximized taxa representation ("no").
  #   requireIDs: (char) IDs that must appear in the output.
  # Returns:
  #   outputIDs: (vector) vector of IDs with maximized taxonomy diversity.


find the children (sub-taxa nodes) of the current taxon

# For cases when one taxon isn't a leaf node, but is an input ID that should
# be available to sample along its children.
# Example of this case is an input with Homo sapiens (9606), 
# H. sapiens neanderthalensis (63221) and H. sapiens ssp. denisova (741158).

check how many offspring each child has
check how many offspring the current taxon has

# Randomize == "yes":
# Balance: allocate ensuring that any two taxa differ by at most 1 if
#           m_i < n_i (or m_i < childrenCount), but allow more if one taxon
#           has m_i == n_i.

# Diversity: fully random child sampling, uniform distribution among taxa.


# randomize == "no":
# Balance: ensure two taxa allocation (m_i) differ at most by 1.
# Diversity: if we don't have the m fully distributed over m_i (children),
#             choose a random child from childrenCount that still has taxa
#             available to choose.
